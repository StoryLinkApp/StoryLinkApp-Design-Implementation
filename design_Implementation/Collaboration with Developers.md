# Working closely with backend and frontend developers: 

- This involves constant communication and cooperation with the developers responsible for the app's functionality (backend) and its user interface (frontend). 

- By collaborating with them, you can understand the technical constraints and possibilities of the platform, and they can provide valuable input on the implementation of your designs.

# Ensuring designs are implementable: 

- While creating your wireframes, prototypes, and visual designs, it's essential to consider the technical limitations and capabilities of the app. 

- Designing within these constraints will make the development process smoother and more efficient.

# Providing design assets and support throughout development: 

- As the app progresses, the development team will require design assets such as icons, images, and other graphical elements. 

- Being readily available to provide these assets and offer support during the development phase ensures that the final product aligns with your original vision.

By working closely with developers and providing the necessary assets and support, **you'll play a crucial role in creating a successful StoryLinkApp with a seamless user experience and visually appealing design.** Your collaboration will be key in bringing the app to life and delivering a product that delights users.
