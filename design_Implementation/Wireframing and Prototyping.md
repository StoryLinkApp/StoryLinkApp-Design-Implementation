# Create wireframes to visualize the layout of key screens, ensuring a clear understanding of user interactions:

- Designers need to sketch out the basic layout of essential screens within the app. 

- These wireframes serve as a blueprint, outlining where different elements will be placed on the screen.

- It's essential to focus on key screens that represent crucial user interactions and functionalities. 

- Wireframes help in visualizing the app's structure and flow, making it easier to identify potential usability issues and ensuring a smooth user experience.

# Build interactive prototypes to validate user flow and navigation before development:

- Designers should go beyond static wireframes and create interactive prototypes. 

- These prototypes allow users to interact with the app as if it were real, helping to validate the user flow and navigation before actual development begins. 

- By testing the app's interactions and usability in this stage, designers can gather valuable feedback and insights. 

- This iterative process allows for improvements and refinements early on, saving time and resources during the development phase.

In summary, as a designer working on the StoryLinkApp, **your tasks involve creating wireframes to plan the layout of crucial screens and their interactions, followed by building interactive prototypes to test and validate the user flow**. These steps are essential for achieving a user-friendly and efficient app design, ensuring a successful user experience once the app is developed.
